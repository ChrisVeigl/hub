# eLearning Sharing Concept

In this example, there are 3 universities: Uni A, Uni B, Uni C.
Imagine each of the universities manages and hosts its own courses in a local instance of a learning management system (LMS) e.g. moodle. The courses are numbered A1…​An, B1…​Bn, C1…​Cn, respectively.
The universities would like to share some of the eLearning courses with other universities in a way that students from other universities can enroll into the shared course, participate at moderated sessions, do exercises and finally get graded by the foreign lecturer.
A central course listing is used to disseminate the shared courses and to make it easier for students to search for topics of interest and respective courses.
In the example shown in the image, course A2 is hosted at university A and has 3 enrolled students from university A, 1 from University B, and 1 from University C.
Course C1 has 3 students from University C and 1 from University B.
