## Range and scope

WIT is the major provider of higher education in the South East region of Ireland and one of the largest IOT's in Ireland. The Institute's range and scope reflect the changing needs of the southeast as well as the country as a whole.

The range of academic programmes is exceptionally extensive, ranging from Higher Certificate right through to post-doctoral research and covering the Humanities, Health and Nursing, Science and Informatics, Engineering and Architecture, Business and Education.

## Lifelong Learning & Access

WIT has been a leader in the Irish higher education sector with regard to the provision of lifelong learning opportunities and access for disadvantaged groups. Many of WIT's successful initiatives in this area have been copied by other colleges. Because of the needs of non-standard groups, WIT has responded by developing expertise in the areas of flexible accreditation, outreach and flexible delivery modes.

## Caring Environment

Providing a caring and supportive learning environment for its students is central to WIT's ethos. The range and quality of student support services is excellent. Examples include the Student Life and Learning Centre and the Medical Centre which provide care, counselling, guidance and support for any student encountering personal, social or health difficulties. Good housing for students is also one of WIT's priorities and the Institute currently owns and/or manages sufficient very high quality students apartments to meet the demand.

## Research and Innovation

There is a thriving research and postgraduate community in WIT. Many of the researchers have a high profile in both the national and EU community of academics. This is shown by the fact that WIT researchers have competed successfully against University researchers for prestigious national and EU research funding (e.g. PRTLI, SFI and EU Frameworks Programme FP4, FP5, FP6 and most recently FP7). Over the last 10 years Waterford Institute of Technology has successfully attracted over â‚¬70 million in research funding.

## International & Industry Links

WIT has formal academic exchange and research partnerships with over 40 universities worldwide. These range from the old established Universities such as Oxford, Trinity College Dublin and University College London to newer technological universities such as Budapest University of Technology and Nanjing University of Science and Technology. In addition WIT has very close relationships with industry & commerce, the professions and the public service for research, consultancy, student and graduate placements etc. A culture of entrepreneurship and innovation is fostered at all levels in the organisation. This can be illustrated by one year enterprise platform programme offered to graduates by the School of Business. Through its School of Humanities it plays a very significant role in the Social and cultural life of its region.
