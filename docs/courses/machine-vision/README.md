## Overview

### Contents

* Introduction to computer vision
* Cameras and optics
* Brightness and color
* Pixels and filters
* Image processing in frequency domain
* Image pyramid
* Machine learning:
  * clustering and classification
  * Edge detection and line overlapping
  * Robust line overlapping (Hough transformation, RANSAC, etc.)
  * Clustering and image segmentation
  * Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  * Points of interest detection
  * Feature tracking
  * Optical flow
  * Stereo correspondence
  * Scaling- and rotation-invariant feature transformation (SIFT, SURF)
  * Visual words dictionaries
  * Recognition and classification of visual objects

### Outcomes

The goal of this course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts and principles of computer vision.
The students who will successfully finish the course will be able to

* design efficient systems for computer vision for handwriting recognition
* detection and recognition of faces
* movement detection
* human and vehicle tracking
* gesture recognition
* classification and recognition of visual objects
* scene analysis and understanding
* etc.

### Methods

Lectures using presentations, interactive lectures, exercises (using equipment and software packages), teamwork, case studies, invited guest lecturers, independent preparation and defense of a project assignment and seminar work.
