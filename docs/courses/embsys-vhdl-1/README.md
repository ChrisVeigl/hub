  description: >
    Andreas Puhm was born in 1982 in Vienna.
    During his study in Electronics on the University of Applied Science Technikum Wien he joined the Vienna Cubes Robocup team which participated in the Robocup WM 2005 in Osaka, Japan.
    In this project he found his interest for Embedded Systems. He finished his Electronics study in 2006 as Dipl. Ing. (FH) and finished a Master study in Embedded Systems on the Technikum Wien in 2008.\n
    In 2006 he joined the Automotive Gateway project team on the Technikum Wien as assistant.
    In 2008 he worked on a industrial project with Zelisko on building a PC/104 based LED Display Matrix for highways.
    From 2008 to 2011 he has been working in the COORDES project with a focus on ASIC toolflow (UMC 90nm process) and design.
    In 2011 he aided Sensor Dynamics (now part of Maxim) in the verification of an ASIC design.
    Since 2011 he is working on the TWASIC project with the goal to provide an ASIC toolflow for the AMS 350nm process technology which can be used for other R&D and also for master student projects.
    Direct output of this project is a 8051 implementation which is also planned to be used in lectures as demonstration material.
    As a result of this project in Februar 2013 the TW8051 has been successfully tested and is currently incorporated into lecture units of the UAS Technikum Wien.\n
    Since 2013 he is working in the Josef Ressel Zentrum for Verification of Embedded Computing Systems on clock synchronization in distributed embedded systems.\n
    Beside that he is holding lectures on VHDL and Distributed Systems (FlexRay).

## Overview

::: post-it
Normally attendance phase at start, but optional,
Course perfectly designed
Participants of this course will learn how to

* Design digital integrated circuits and systems with the hardware
  description language VHDL and FPGAs as target Technology
* Design and implement multi-task embedded software applications
  under a real-time operating system which is running on a microcontroller platform
* Write a bachelor thesis under supervision in
  a technical field (which includes all practical work)
