:::

* The Internet of Things protocol stack
* Device level communication bus protocols: Event-driven bus protocols; serial communication
* Device interfacing and embedded application APIs
* Wireless communication for the IoT: Introduction to Wireless Networks; wireless protocols for low power devices; short-range wireless technologies
* Messaging protocols for the Internet of Things: Request-Response; Publish-Subscribe

### Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, a student will be able to:

1. Distinguish between the communication and data requirements for the general Web protocol stack and Internet of Things protocol stack.
2. Create an appropriate physical layer specification for wireless networked devices based on application requirements.
3. Use low power, low overhead, wireless communication protocols to interconnect resource constrained sensors, actuators and other devices.
4. Apply lightweight messaging solutions that mediate between device level sensors and higher layer applications and services.
5. Use IoT gateway solutions to connect devices and higher level service layer networks.
6. Design domain-specific IoT solutions (e.g. health care) using suitable IoT protocols and standards.

### Methods

* Combination of lectures and computer/network laboratory work.
* Labs will provide practical knowledge into the design and implementation of IoT-specific communication protocol solutions.
* Lectures will provide the theoretical knowledge of IoT protocols and standards.
* As part of the lectures, case studies will be used to illustrate real-world IoT solutions using the standards and protocols covered in lectures(e.g. smart spaces).
