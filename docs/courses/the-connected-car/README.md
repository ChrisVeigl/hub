## Overview

### Contents

* Vehicle network architectures
* Event-triggered network protocols (CAN-FD; XCP; ISO 15765)
* Time-triggered network protocols (LIN; FlexRay)
* Infotainment network protocols (MOST; IP)
* Measurement, Calibration and Diagnostics
* Car2x protocols (Context Awareness; Event Notification; Topology)
* Car2x use cases
* Network simulation and testing
* Network security

### Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, a student will be able to:

* Distinguish the characteristics of the different network protocols.
* Compare and contrast common automotive protocols.
* Formulate application networking requirements.
* Design gateway network protocols.
* Evaluate security requirements for a connected vehicle.
* Set up and appraise industry standard network development and testing tools.

### Methods

* Combination of lectures and laboratory-based practicals.
* Self-directed learning.
