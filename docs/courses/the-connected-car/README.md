## Description

In this module, students explore and use the technologies required to exchange data between Electronic Control
Units within the vehicle and with external systems outside of the vehicle, such as other vehicles, diagnostic
tools, recharging stations and roadside infrastructure.

## Indicative Content

* Vehicle network architectures
* Event-triggered network protocols (CAN-FD; XCP; ISO 15765)
* Time-triggered network protocols (LIN; FlexRay)
* Infotainment network protocols (MOST; IP)
* Measurement, Calibration and Diagnostics
* Car2x protocols (Context Awareness; Event Notification; Topology)
* Car2x use cases
* Network simulation and testing
* Network security

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, a student will be able to:

1. Distinguish the characteristics of the different network protocols.
2. Compare and contrast common automotive protocols.
3. Formulate application networking requirements.
4. Design gateway network protocols.
5. Evaluate security requirements for a connected vehicle.
6. Set up and appraise industry standard network development and testing tools.
