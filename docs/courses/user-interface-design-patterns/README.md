# User interface design patterns

::: slot description
The purpose of the course is to introduce the basic problems of user interfaces and approaches of how to solve them for different types of user interfaces and user interactions.
:::

## Overview

### Contents

* Introduction
* User behavior when working with interactive systems, patterns to describe user behavior
* Information architecture
* Interaction patterns
* Content organization in interactive systems
  * Organizational schemes
  * Structure organization
  * Patterns for organizing and displaying data
* Navigation
  * Problems and principles for good navigation
  * Patterns in interactive systems
* Screen organization
    * Basic concepts
    * Techniques for grouping and arranging elements
     * Patterns for organizing screens
* Forms and data entry
  * Principles for designing forms
  * Types of input data and controls
  * Patterns for designing forms (relationships between elements, values of elements ...)
* Actions and commands
  * Representation and rendering of actions
  * Commands patterns
* Interaction with data lists
* Interaction in social media
* Interaction in mobile devices, features of the interaction in mobile devices, interaction patterns.

### Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to

- demonstrate knowledge about the basic principles of effective and efficient user interaction
- apply the basic principles when designing a user interface
- develop an interactive application following the learned principles

### Methods

Lectures using presentations, interactive lectures, exercises (using equipment and software packages), teamwork, case studies, invited guest lecturers, independent preparation and defense of a project assignment and a seminar work.

## Assessment

### Methods

| Type                  | Points |
| :-------------------- | :------------- |
| Lab exercises         | x points      |
| Quizzes |xx points      |
| Colloquium 1            | x points      |
| Colloquium 2            | x points      |

### Minimum Requirements

The course is passed if at least 50% of the points (101 points) are collected from all activities (practical exam, laboratory exercises and theoretical tests) no matter how many points are collected from each of the activities.

### Laboratory exercises

Each student should solve and upload tasks within the given deadline. We count all timely uploaded solutions. To obtain points for this part, each student has to take an exam that consists of one of already assigned tasks. The exam can be taken ONLY ONCE during the January examination period. The total number of points is calculated by scaling the number of points earned on the test with the number of timely uploaded solution. The maximum number of points is won only if all exercises are uploaded on time. If the student does not take the laboratory test, he will obtain 0 points of the same.

### Quizzes for theory

These tests consist of short questions related to details of the lectures. Quizzes are taken on Moodle along with colloquiums (two separate quizzes with the first and second colloquium) or the practical exam (single quiz together with the practical exam in examination period). 

### Colloquiums (recommended)

Colloquiums consist of a practical problem. You need to solve the problem by programming (if the solution is correct you can obtain the maximum number of points defined for the task) or by drawing the screen layout (if the solution is correct you can obtain only a part of the points defined for the tasks). No minimum points for passing the colloquium are defined (You can participate in the second colloquium even if you obtain zero points on the first colloquium). 

### Criteria

| Grade | Grade (letter) | Scale            |
| :---- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| 5     | F              | up to 50 points  |
| 6     | E              | 51 to 60 points  |
| 7     | D              | 61 to 70 points  |
| 8     | C              | 71 to 80 points  |
| 9     | B              | 81 to 90 points  |
| 10    | A              | 91 to 100 points |
