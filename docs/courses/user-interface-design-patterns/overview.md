### Outcomes

The purpose of the course is to introduce basic problems of user interfaces and approaches of solving them for different types of user interfaces and user interaction.

Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to

* Demonstrate knowledge of the basic principles of effective and efficient user interaction
* The principles for their design
* Independently develop interactive applications using programming tools following the learned principles
