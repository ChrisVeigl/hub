## Goals/Competencies

After the completion of the course it is expected for students to be capable of using basic methods for productive creation of computer based animations and working with applications for creating animations.
They should be able to model, apply textures, rig, add lights, animate, render and compose digital scenes.

## Course Content

* basic principles of 3D space
* describing digital scenes
* hierarchical organization
* polygonal geometry
* modeling of digital objects and characters
* NURBS modeling
* deformation techniques
* rigging of objects and characters
* principles of animation
* animating digital characters
* shading and materials
* texturing
* UV coordinates
* lights in digital scenes
* cameras
* scripting and automation
* compositing and post-production
