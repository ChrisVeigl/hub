## What is it?

The StudyATHome hub is a listing of eLearning courses hosted and operated by universities of the StudyATHome [partner network](/studyathome/partner/).
## How does it work?

Students which are matriculated at any of the partner universities may enroll in one of the listed [courses](/courses/). They will have to do exams and assignments remotely and will get a grade certificate issued by the partner university upon completion of the course. Finally, the students will have to take the certificate for recognition at the home university.
