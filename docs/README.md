## What is it?

The StudyATHome hub is a listing of eLearning courses hosted and operated by universities of the StudyATHome [partner network](./studyathome/partner/). Students which are matriculated at any of the partner universities may enroll in one of the listed [courses](./courses/). They will have to do exams and assignments remotely and will get a grade certificate issued by the partner university upon completion of the course. Finally, the students will have to take the certificate for recognition at the home university.

## How does it work?
